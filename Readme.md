## Introduction

This repository serves as the basis for the website and future web app map.velosofize.com and is planned to be open-sourced in the near future, once an appropriate license is chosen (likely AGPL). It is intended as a free-to-use platform in the long-term which sources data from personal contributions of the project's creator and from Velosofize's users (all accessible in Google Maps and Google Earth as well) and OpenStreetMap data from openmaptiles.

The focus of the project is to gather as much information as possible that Bulgarian cyclists need in their day-to-day, all in one place. It serves also as a catalogue of other projects in this niche. The data should be, as much as possible, accessible through apps that the majority of Bulgarian mobile users are already familiar with, e.g. through browsers, Google Maps and Google Earth and the underlying routes are to be accessible for export so that users can make their own modifications.

The Velosofize project includes resources from other repositories, such as velosofist/velosofize and velosofist/velosofize-minima-theme , which account for the blog section of the website (docs.velosofize.com) and its styling.
